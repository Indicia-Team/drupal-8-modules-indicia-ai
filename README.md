# drupal-module-indicia-ai

A set of modules for automated identification of species.

There are multiple proxy modules for communicating with various services and
a single indicia_ai module offering a uniform interface to all the available 
services.

Refer to the README of each module for a detailed description. It is the
intention that users will only interact with the indicia_ai module.
